This blog post will go through the 10 best things I learned as I went through my Sinatra Project.

The project was a content manager system (CMS) for lean business plans. You can sign up; log in and view the plans that are in the system; create a new plan; and edit and delete your own plans. My git is located at [https://github.com/cavu757/sinatra-project-leanbplan](https://github.com/cavu757/sinatra-project-leanbplan).

I will repeat myself (from the CLI project)… You CAN do this. But this time, what I learned is that life and time waits for no one.
