So I have reached day 34 of my software development journey as a part-time student in the immersive course with the Flatiron School (and day 44 of my #100daysofcode). There are many new things I have learned and I know that we have just scratched the surface. So far we have learned Ruby fundamental programming and some Ruby object oriented programming. Both have their difficulties and challenges and are awesome in their own way. While going through one of the object-oriented programming resource videos, the instructor spelled out what I considered to be my first four best practices for software development (first in the chronological sense, not by importance).
