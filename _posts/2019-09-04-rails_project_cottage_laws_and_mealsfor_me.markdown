First of all, as always, you can do thisâ€¦ Now that we got that out of the way, as I was thinking on how to write the blog for my Rails project for the Flatiron School, I decided that I would go a little bit into the features I incorporated such as OAuth and nested resources but also into some of the things I learned about cottage laws and the food industry. Great to know for any cooking related app out there. Oh, and also what I learned about scope creep.
