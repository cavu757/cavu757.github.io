**Holy mackerel**, this is it. We have landed. This is a blog post of my last project for the Software Engineering Bootcamp at the Flatiron School. Not a bad run for a cold start on a wintry day in February 2019. The journey has had many ups and downs, I have been able to help some people, and others have helped me a lot more. I would like to thank the Flatiron School, the instructors and especially my classmates for the support and hope that I am able to keep in touch with them. I had many grandiose ideas of what I wanted to create but I also knew that I had to finish so the final decision was something simple but something that still would hit all the requirements. See the full project here: https://github.com/cavu757/bullet-projects-app

About a year ago, I was introduced to bullet journaling and even though it is all about going back to the analog mode of keeping a journal, I have always wanted to see an app with all the same functionality. Visit the Bullet Journal website at [https://bulletjournal.com/pages/learn](https://bulletjournal.com/pages/learn) to see an explanation of how to bullet journal.

I had always wanted to get a Bullet Journal App so I set out to create an app that would clone the skills of bullet journaling. The one twist I added was that it would be a bullet journal for separate projects. With my app, you can create a project and add tasks, events and notes for each project and these are annotated using standard bullet journal notation. In this blog, I will go through some of the “a-ha” moments that I had through the project whether it was a new tip that I found or another feature of the languages that I did not know existed or had forgotten about.
