I am not talking about the recent Transformers' Bumblebee movie... even though you can learn a lot about loyalty, courage and other great attributes from one of my favorite autobots.  

But I digress, let's get back to the bumblebee.  My favorite urban legend is about the regular bumblebee which, acording to the laws of aerodynamics,  should not be able to fly.  But as the myth goes, the bumblebee doesn't know this therefore it goes on flying.  It is a feel-good urban legend of doing what is thought to be impossible.  Is it true?  Technically, yes, if the bumblebee's wings were rigid as a regular airplane's wings, it would not be able to fly.  But, because its wings bend and twist to shift the aerodynamic flow over their surface and create the appropriate lift to allow it to fly.  Does it matter that it may not be true?  Not really, because I would rather believe it and apply the lesson that it is worth taking a risk and doing something that may seem impossible such as shifting careers at an older age.  

Why software development? Well, I don't want to brag but I started my career in software programming in 1987.  Well, it really was not a career, it was just a class in my primary school in programming in Basic.  It was so cool to be able to program a computer.  I still remember my best project which was a line drawing of the iconic Empire's Luke vs. Darth Vader lightsaber duel.  (Graphic recreation below)

It really looked like that, it was awesome.

I remember I really liked the programming class.  After that class and while I was growing up in Lima, Peru, there were four careers that I wanted pursue when I grew up:  astronaut, doctor, architect or computer programmer.  All had one thing in common, you have to be willing to be uncomfortable.  Whether in the air or space, operating room, designing table or in front of a computer screen, nothing will ever go the way you have planned.  This unknown always intrigued me.  I continued studying and growing up.  Many things happened that led to moving to the United States at the age of 14.  Fast forward a few years, I did not get to be an astronaut but was blessed enough to graduate from the Naval Academy and become a helicopter pilot.  Even though I loved flying (really, there is nothing like it.), there was something happening on the fringes.  As I went through my Navy career, everywhere I went, my squadron and shipmates would always call me the "A/V club president"  because I loved to tinker with computers, videos, graphic design, etc.  Since I was focused on the Navy, it never crossed my mind to program or anything but I would use commercially available solutions to create WYSIWYG projects.  Fast forward a few more years and I believe I have had a great career in the Navy.  I have loved giving back to the country that gave me and my family a chance to succeed.  I have learned many things and have served with the most amazing people.  But, the time has come to make a change and transition to the civilian world.  

My countdown currently stands at about 18 months until I transition.  For the past few months, I did not know where I wanted to land or what I wanted to do.  I talked to many people about different career options.  Some were more feasible than others but nothing really fully called my attention.  It was only after talking to some friends and family members that are in the software development field that I realized that the answer was right there.  I had always loved to create new things, to think about things differently, to make things that make life easier and, above all, every time I use an application or a website, I am always thinking of other features that I would like to create to improve it.  Software Development was the choice I needed to make.  

Is it scary?  Yes.  Is it a risk?  Probably.  Can I do it?  I want to say most definitely.  

One thing that you have probably noticed is that I have used "love" in many places in this post.  I can't help it.  I haved always loved what I've done and I think I will love what I will do with software development.  And it is serendipitous that the Flatiron way is love.  Learn. Love. Code.

Meant to be, why not.
